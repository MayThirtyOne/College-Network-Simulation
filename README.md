# College-Network-Simulation
Simulation of College LAN Network in CISCO Packet Tracer to fix latency

# Description
This project was completed as a part of the course curriculum. With the help of CISCO Packet Tracer, we were able to simulate the network architectural design of a typical internal college network. The network activities were simulated between various departments and independent machines and a report was generated on how to improve the latency of communication between any two nodes.

# Technologies Used
Python for data analysis, CISCO Packet Tracer for simulation
